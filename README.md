## Distribution

- tokenIds `8001` to `15777` claimable by user.
- tokenIds `15778` to `16000` claimable by contract owner.
- Each token has attributes: `chest`, `foot`, `hand`, `head`, `neck`, `ring`, `waist`, `weapon`.

## Output

- `output/loot.json` contains all tokenIds and their attributes.
- `output/occurences.json` contains the number of occurences by attribute.
- `output/rare.json` contains a mapping of `lootId` to `score` (which is the sum of number of occcrences of each child attribute for a `lootId`), sorted ascending by `score`. It also includes `rarest` which is how rare the loot bags attributes are (`1` == `rarest`, `8000` == `least rare`).
- `output/images.json` contains the base64 encoded SVG of each tokenId
